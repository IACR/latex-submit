  abstract =      {In order to protect user data while maintaining application functionality, encrypted databases can use specialized cryptography such as property-revealing encryption, which allows a property of the underlying plaintext values to be computed from the ciphertext. One example is deterministic encryption which ensures that the same plaintext encrypted under the same key will produce the same ciphertext. This technology enables clients to make queries on sensitive data hosted in a cloud server and has considerable potential to protect data. However, the security implications of deterministic encryption are not well understood.We provide a leakage analysis of deterministic encryption through the application of the framework of quantitative information flow. A key insight from this framework is that there is no single "right'' measure by which leakage can be quantified: information flow depends on the operational scenario and different operational scenarios require different leakage measures. We evaluate leakage under three operational scenarios, modeled using three different gain functions, under a variety of prior distributions in order to bring clarity to this problem.},

In recent years, concerns have been raised about ''side-channel'' attacks on various cryptosystems---attacks that make use of some kind of leaked information about the cryptographic operations (e.g., power consumption or timing) to defeat them. In this paper, we describe a somewhat different kind of side-channel provided by data compression algorithms, yielding information about their inputs by the size of their outputs. The existence of some information about a compressor's input in the size of its output is obvious; here, we discuss ways to use this apparently very small leak of information in surprisingly powerful ways.},

  abstract =      {We prove that with high probability over the choice of a random graph \$G\$ from the Erd{\"o}s--R{\'e}nyi distribution \$G(n,1/2)\$, the \$n^{O(d)}\$-time degree \$d\$ sum-of-squares (SOS) semidefinite programming relaxation for the clique problem will give a value of at least \$n^{1/2-c(d/\log n)^{1/2}}\$ for some constant \$c>0\$. This yields a nearly tight \$n^{1/2 - o(1)}\$ bound on the value of this program for any degree \$d = o(\log n)\$. Moreover, we introduce a new framework that we call pseudocalibration to construct SOS lower bounds. This framework is inspired by taking a computational analogue of Bayesian probability theory. It yields a general recipe for constructing good pseudodistributions (i.e., dual certificates for the SOS semidefinite program) and sheds further light on the ways in which this hierarchy differs from others.},

  abstract =      {Approximation algorithms can sometimes provide efficient solutions when no efficient exact computation is known. In particular, approximations are often useful in a distributed setting where the inputs are held by different parties and may be extremely large. Furthermore, for some applications, the parties want to compute a function of their inputs securely without revealing more information than necessary. In this work, we study the question of simultaneously addressing the above efficiency and security concerns via what we call secure approximations.We start by extending standard definitions of secure (exact) computation to the setting of secure approximations. Our definitions guarantee that no additional information is revealed by the approximation beyond what follows from the output of the function being approximated. We then study the complexity of specific secure approximation problems. In particular, we obtain a sublinear-communication protocol for securely approximating the Hamming distance and a polynomial-time protocol for securely approximating the permanent and related #P-hard problems.},

We develop the necessary probability theory to rigorously state and reason about properties of probabilistic systems. Then we give two definitions of information flow security that make use of this formalism. Intuitively, information flow security is the aspect of computer security concerned with how information is permitted to flow through a computer system. The first definition is based on Goguen and Meseguer's Noninterference; the second is based on McLean's FM. We prove that the second definition is strictly stronger than the first. We give a verification condition for information flow security and prove that it implies both of our definitions. Finally, we show some relationships between our definitions and other definitions in the literature, including definitions from classical information theory.},
