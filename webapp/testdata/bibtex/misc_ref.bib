abstract="In 1979 a note of L. G. Khachiyan indicated how an algorithm, the so-called ellipsoid method, originally devised for nonlinear nondifferentiable optimization, can be modified in order to check the feasibility of a system of linear inequalities in polynomial time. This result caused great excitement in the world of mathematical programming since it implies the polynomial time solvability of linear programming problems.",

	abstract="The lattice isomorphism problem (LIP) asks one to find an isometry between two lattices. It has recently been proposed as a foundation for cryptography in two independent works [Ducas {\&} van Woerden, EUROCRYPT 2022, Bennett et al. preprint 2021]. This problem is the lattice variant of the code equivalence problem, on which the notion of the hull of a code can lead to devastating attacks.",
