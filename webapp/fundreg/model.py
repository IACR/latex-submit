"""
This contains the data model for indexed entities. The main classes
are Funder and FunderList. Both Relationship and Funder inherit from
GlobalEntity because they have a data source and id within that source.

The FunderType below is a union of types found in both ROR and FundReg
(but mostly ROR). The distribution of types that we found in FundReg are:
   7503 Trusts, charities, foundations (both public and private) => NONPROFIT
   5666 Universities (academic only) => EDU
   4774 Local government => GOV
   3251 National government => GOV
   2860 Associations and societies (private and public) => OTHER
   2813 Research institutes and centers => INSTITUTE
   2497 Other non-profit organizations => NONPROFIT
   2590 For-profit companies (industry) => COMPANY
    263 International organizations => OTHER
     31 Libraries and data archiving organizations => ARCHIVE

Funder types in ROR have the following distribution:
  29547 Company => COMPANY
  19972 Education => EDU
  13872 Nonprofit => NONPROFIT
  13024 Healthcare => HEALTH
   9406 Facility => FAC
   8150 Other => OTHER
   6138 Government => GOV
   2853 Archive => ARCHIVE
