  This site is under development and is not yet ready to be used. It is here only for
  testing purposes.
</div>
<p>
  This site is intended to become part of the IACR publishing
  pipeline, starting with the IACR Communications in Cryptology. Our
  goal is to reduce the cost of open access publishing by reducing the
  amount of human effort required by both authors and editors in the
  production of a paper. Once a paper is accepted, authors will be
  directed to this site in order to submit their final versions in
  LaTeX format.  Their sources will be compiled, and after some light
  copy editing, the paper will be ready for publication within seconds
  rather than weeks or months.
</p>
<p>
  Papers submitted to the IACR Communications in Cryptology will be required to use the
  <a href="/iacrcc"><span class="text-monospace">iacrcc</span></a> document class. At
  the present time we also support uploads for other publishing venues, but the main purpose
  of this site is to support a new generation of LaTeX document classes. The approach
  for this journal is described in <a href="/main.pdf">this paper</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of this system is:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Safely validate that the LaTeX compiles correctly under the new
    <a href="/iacrcc"><span class="text-monospace">iacrcc</span></a> document class.</li>
  <li>Validate that the author has supplied sufficient metadata (e.g., title, affiliations,
    funding information, etc).</li>
  <li>Assign a DOI immediately upon submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Automated submission systems like this are a bit complicated to run because it is generally
  unsafe to accept LaTeX sources from an untrusted source. This system does not support all
  of the thousands of LaTeX packages. The list of supported packages is given below, along
  with <a href="#unsupported">some packages that are explicitly forbidden</a>.
