      The goal of this site is to reduce the cost of open access publishing by
      <a href="http://ftp.tug.org/TUGboat/tb44-1/tb136bos-metadata.pdf">reducing the
        amount of human labor</a> by both authors and editors. Once a
      paper is accepted, authors will be directed to a URL on this site
      in order to submit their final versions in LaTeX format.  Their
      sources will be compiled, during which metadata is automatically
      extracted. The paper will be routed to a copy editor, who is provided
      with structured information about possible improvements in the LaTeX.
      Authors will have an opportunity to respond and upload their final
      version.  The process is designed to make sure that papers are
      published within four months of submission.

  {#At
  the present time we also support uploads for other publishing venues, but the main purpose
  of this site is to support a new generation of LaTeX document classes.
  The approach
  for this journal is described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08277.pdf">this paper</a>.#}
</p>
{#<p>
  The purpose of this system is:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Safely validate that the LaTeX compiles correctly under the new
    <a href="/iacrcc"><span class="text-monospace">iacrcc</span></a> document class.</li>
  <li>Validate that the author has supplied sufficient metadata (e.g., title, affiliations,
    funding information, etc).</li>
  <li>Assign a DOI immediately upon submission.</li>
</ol>#}
