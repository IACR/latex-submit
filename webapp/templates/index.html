  This site is currently used for submissions of <strong>final</strong> versions of
  papers for <a href="https://cic.iacr.org/">IACR Communications in Cryptology</a>.
 If you are looking to submit a paper to the journal, see
  the <a href="https://cic.iacr.org/callforpapers.php">Call for Papers</a>.
</div>
<p>
  Papers submitted to the IACR Communications in Cryptology are required to use the
  <a href="/iacrcc"><span class="text-monospace">iacrcc</span></a> document class.
</p>
<p>
  The goal of this site is to reduce the cost of open access publishing by reducing the
  amount of human effort required by both authors and editors in the
  production of a paper. Once a paper is accepted, authors will be
  directed to a URL on this site in order to submit their final versions in
  LaTeX format.  Their sources will be compiled, and after some light
  copy editing, the paper will be ready for publication within seconds
  rather than weeks or months.
</p>
<p>
  {#At
  the present time we also support uploads for other publishing venues, but the main purpose
  of this site is to support a new generation of LaTeX document classes.
  The approach
  for this journal is described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08277.pdf">this paper</a>.#}
</p>
{#<p>
  The purpose of this system is:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Safely validate that the LaTeX compiles correctly under the new
    <a href="/iacrcc"><span class="text-monospace">iacrcc</span></a> document class.</li>
  <li>Validate that the author has supplied sufficient metadata (e.g., title, affiliations,
    funding information, etc).</li>
  <li>Assign a DOI immediately upon submission.</li>
</ol>#}
