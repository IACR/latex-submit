This is an abstract. We prove that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dogs are worse than cats
\item Dogs are more annoying than fish.
\item Cats are more loving than fish.
\item Cats of $<10$ pounds do not have fleas.
\end{itemize}

We also show that
\begin{enumerate}
\item items are ordered when $a<b$
\item there are two items
\item oops there is a third item.
\end{enumerate}
