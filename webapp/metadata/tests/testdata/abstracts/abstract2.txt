%% just a comment
First paragraph is here.

Try this with $a=b$ to see what happens with $x=\zeta(s^2)$ until %
an $(x_1, ... x_n)$ is a vector in the
abstract with short lines. This decreases by 10\%

until it is smaller than 5\% again. Note that $a<b$ will be
changed, as will $a>b$.

Now see what happens if
\begin{itemize}
\item First
\item second
\end{itemize}

another paragraph.
